abstract: >
  We overview the recent result [3, Theorem 1.1] about the high-frequency instability of Stokes waves subject to longitudinal perturbations. The spectral bands of unstable eigenvalues away from the origin form a sequence of isolas parameterized by an integer 𝚙≥2 for any value of the depth 𝚑>0 such that an explicit analytic function β^(𝚙)_1(𝚑) is not zero. In [3] it is proved that the map 𝚑↦β^(𝚙)_1(𝚑) is not identically zero for any 𝚙≥2. In this manuscript we compute the asymptotic expansion of β(𝚙)1(𝚑) in the deep-water limit 𝚑→+∞ -- it vanishes exponentially fast to zero -- for 𝚙=2, 3, 4.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: >
  We prove asymptotic expansion when the depth goes to infinity of the function $\beta^{(p)}_1(h)$ for $p=2,3,4$.
